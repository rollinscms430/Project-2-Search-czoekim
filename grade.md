## Anagrams

Looks good.

## Word Ladder

Very nice, clean, and concise implementation. Finds the shortest path.

Excellent work!

## Boggle

Good. Again, very concise and clean implementation. Interesting choice to use an explicit stack instead of making it recursive, but
it works well.

I also like the use of list comprehensions when performing the stack updates. That's a vey effective Pythonic style.
